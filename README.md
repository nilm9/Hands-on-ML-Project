## About The Project

Welcome to the `Hands on Machine Learning Project`, created by `Nil Monfort`. This repository is dedicated to my journey through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. Here, I not only delve into the concepts and techniques presented in each chapter but also apply them practically through various projects.

### Objectives

- **Learning and Understanding:** Deep dive into each chapter to grasp the intricacies of machine learning concepts.
- **Practical Implementation:** Applying learned concepts to real-world datasets or problems.
- **Summary and Notes:** Providing a concise summary of each chapter for quick reviews and future reference.
- **Community Contribution:** Sharing my learning journey with the community, welcoming feedback, and collaborating on interesting machine learning problems.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn
- Flask

## Structure of the Repository

Each chapter of the book corresponds to a separate folder in this repository. The folders are structured as follows:

- **Chapter Summaries:** Concise notes and key takeaways from each chapter.
- **Code Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code, experiments, and my personal insights.
- **Projects:** Practical projects based on the concepts learned in each chapter.
